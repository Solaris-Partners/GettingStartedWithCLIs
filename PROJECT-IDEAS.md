## Tips for Success

1. **Start small** — Get one thing working before adding complexity
2. **Use real data** — Toy examples are less satisfying; use actual work problems
3. **Iterate** — Version 1 won't be perfect. Ship it, use it, improve it
4. **Document as you go** — Future you will thank present you
5. **Share what works** — If you build something useful, others might benefit

---
