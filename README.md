A beginner-friendly guide to using command-line interfaces (CLIs) for business professionals who want to unlock the power of AI coding assistants.

## Who This Is For

You're a business professional—maybe you work in operations, finance, marketing, HR, or management. You've probably used Claude through the website (claude.ai) or the desktop app. That's great for conversations, but there's a more powerful way to work with AI.

**Claude Code** runs in your terminal (command line) and can actually read, write, and edit files on your computer. It's the difference between *talking about* work and *doing* work.

This guide will take you from zero to productive, even if you've never opened a terminal in your life.

## Why Use a CLI Instead of the Desktop App?

| Desktop Claude | Claude Code (CLI) |
|----------------|-------------------|
| Chat conversations | Chat + file access |
| Copy/paste text manually | Read files directly from your computer |
| Describe what you want | Actually create and edit files |
| Talk about code | Run code and commands |
| Limited context | Full access to your projects |

**The bottom line:** Claude Code can do things the desktop app simply cannot. It's like the difference between describing a recipe and having a chef cook it for you.
